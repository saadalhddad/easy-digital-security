Understanding Phishing Attacks
Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack, or the revealing of sensitive information.

How to Identify Phishing
Suspicious Sender: The email address might look similar but not identical to a legitimate one.

Generic Greetings: Instead of your name, it might say "Dear Customer."

Urgent Language: Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency to pressure you into acting quickly.

Bad Grammar/Spelling: Professional organizations usually have well-written communications.

Unusual Links: Hover over links to see the actual URL before clicking. If it looks suspicious, don't click.

Protecting Yourself
Be Skeptical: Always question unexpected emails or messages.

Verify Sender: If unsure, contact the organization directly using a known, legitimate phone number or email, not the one provided in the suspicious message.

Use Strong Security: Enable 2FA, use strong passwords, and keep your software updated.

Report Phishing: Most email providers have a way to report phishing attempts.
